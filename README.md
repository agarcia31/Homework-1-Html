# Using a SEO

The webpage is a flyer for a SEO company. Promotes the reason why they are the best choice to go with.

## What I fix
The code had some html format issues. I correct the html format by adding sections, fix all img link and adding alt description for
all imgs needed. I also correct the css folder. Line everything up to fix mock up. Lastly I added comments on the code to help the next
user understand what to look for and where to looj.
